# WhiteCat
I test the collection of effective blockchain security tools and platforms, and add/delete them irregularly.



•	Rektosaurus - A test suite to check for client-side script injection on websites that display NFTs.

•	Ethereum Data Warehouse by Token Flow.

•	Transaction Preview API — Real-Time Insights For Ethereum Mainnet by Blocknative.

•	EVM Codes - opcodes, playground, and others.

•	Conkas is a modular static analysis tool for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based on symbolic execution.

•	Brownie: Evaluating Solidity Code Coverage via Opcode Tracing - a new framework for Ethereum smart contract testing through code coverage analysis.

•	VeriMan Project - a new analysis tool for Solidity smart contract. It helps instrument VeriSol, Manticore, and optionally Echidna to effectively discover vulnerabilities through counterexample discovery and fuzzing smart contracts. You can download the tool source here.

•	EVulHunter - a new static analysis tool for EOS smart contracts was just released along with a paper and a video demonstration. The tools is based on the Octopus project.

•	Kryptology - advanced cryptography library by Coinbase.

•	Foundry - Ethereum development toolbox by Paradigm.

•	Circomspect - static analyzer and linter for the Circom and tutorial.

•	Qiling Framework - advanced binary emulation network with EVM support and tutorial.

•	Tornadoxxed address deanonymization tool.


•	MEV-Explore dashboard keeps track of frontrunning bots.

•	AddrJack - an education demo of a Bitcoin address-swapping malware.

•	Scribble runtime verification tool by Consensys Dilligence.

•	Symbolic Execution with ds-test allows Ethereum developers to quickly write formal proofs for smart contracts.

•	Revoke is an Ethereum tool to enumerate Dapps which requested to spend excessive amounts of tokens on your behalf.

•	RandomX Sniffer - a PoC tool to detect traces of running RandomX ransomware algorithm in CPU registers.

•	Solana Playground.

•	Whatsabi - tool to extract ABIs from unverified contracts.

•	Check the Chain (CTC) - a tool for collecting and analyzing data from Ethereum and other EVM chains.

•	Transaction debugging tools thread by SunSec.

•	Tarantula by Consensys Dilligence a tool to help with fault localisation.

•	VeriSol - Microsoft Research formal verification tool for Solidity smart contracts. The tool is based on the Boogie verification toolchain and works on the Solidity source code. You can read the announcement on Microsoft’s Research Blog.
